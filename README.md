## SCA - Backend
> The objective of this project is to create an authentication system for the Anápolis Air Base.

## Development Environment

As a prerequisite, you will need to install: MySql, Node(we recommend the latest stable version available), Insomnia (or Postman) to test the API.

> Inside the backend/run.sh script, edit the informations to match with your environment.

> The file insomnia-sca.json needs to be imported at Insomnia to access the endpoints


## Installation
```sh
cd backend/
npm install
```

## Running the server
### Development
```sh
cd backend/
npm run dev
```
### Production
```sh
cd backend/
npm run start
```

## How to access Swagger documentation
> Now with the server running, open the browser and go to http://localhost:3000/doc/. 
> There you can find all the endpoints, the params, and all you need to know about the api.
